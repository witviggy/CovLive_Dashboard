# CovLive_Dashboard

The project involves creating a live dashboard using Power BI to visualize and track real-time health data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) website (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). The main objectives are:

Data Integration: Regularly fetch and clean data from MOHFW, and potentially integrate it with other relevant data sources for a comprehensive view.

Data Visualization: Utilize Power BI to design interactive visualizations, including geospatial maps, and demographic breakdowns, to present COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, testing rates etc.

Interactivity: Implement filters, and drill-through functionality to allow users to customize their data view.

This live dashboard project aims to provide a valuable resource for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public by offering up-to-date insights into the COVID-19 situation in India.
